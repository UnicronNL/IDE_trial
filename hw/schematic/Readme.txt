I have no longer access to the tool which would produce a PDF
version of the schematic. So all I can do now is provide screen shots.
The PCB has an FPGA on it but that was 'just in case'. 
I never used it for any of my SW.
This means that all which is required at this moment in the project
are a number of wires from one connector to another.
